# MERN-authentication-demo


This repository provides a robust, production-ready authentication boilerplate built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It implements secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and HTTP-only cookies for managing session state. This setup is ideal for quickly starting any full-stack MERN application that requires reliable and protected user sign-up, sign-in, and access control.
